### Dynamic, Per Request, Image Processing

At its core, Jmg will manipulate images by a given set of parameters.
Parameters are defined by their mode where each mode represents a different
operation (mainly resizing and cropping). Parametes can also be joind by filters.

Parameters may be passed as query or you may define them as placeholder parameter
in the routing framework of your choice.
